                <p>According to local legend, the term Pindaya is a corruption of the word Pinguya, which translates to Taken the Spider in Burmese. The name arose from the legend that there was once a large spider which resided in the caves and it had captured a local princess.</p>

                <p>The legend associated with the pagoda is that the Buddha, on one of his many visits, gave a strand of his hair to Taik Tha, a hermit. The hermit, who had tucked it in the tuft of his hair safely, in turn gave the strand to the king, with the wish that the hair be enshrined in a boulder shaped like the hermit's head. </p>

                <p>The legend of Kakku goes far back to the 3th century B.C to the region of King Ashoka of the Indian Empire, and also to the 11th century Bagan dynasty during the region of the famous King Alaung Sithu.

                    It is a well known fact that King Ashoka purified and propagated the Buddhist religion throughout the Indian Empire and extending even future to Myanmar.</p>

                <p>The name of Rid Dil is said derived from a Mizo folktale of a girl named Rih-i. According to legend, Rih-i and her younger sister had a cruel stepmother, who persuaded their father to get rid of them. The father killed the younger sister in a forest. Upon finding her decapitated sister, Rih-i found was inconsolable. A good spirit known as Lasi found her and took pity on her. She revealed her a magical tree having a single leaf with which Rih-i revived her sister back to life. </p>

                <p>Like most of Mrauk U's Buddhist temples, it is designed as a dual purpose 'fortress-temple'. According to Emil Forchhammer, an archaeologist employed by the British Raj to study Mrauk U in the late 19th century, the temples might have been employed as a refuge for the Buddhist religious order in times of war.</p>

                <p>Inle Lake is a major tourist attraction, and this has led to some development of tourist infrastructure. Many small and large privately owned hotels and tour operations have arisen during the past few years. Local shops are flooded with consumer items, both local and foreign.</p>

                <p>Indawgyi Lake is within the confines of Indawgyi Lake Wildlife Sanctuary, which was established in 1999 by the Ministry of Ecotourism. The sanctuary, which encompasses 780 km2 (300 sq mi), contains a variety of animal species, including rare mammals and birds.[2] Indawgyi hosts more than 65 species of fish, but none are endemic. A few fish that historically were believed to be endemic are now known to also occur elsewhere.</p>
